# Teiko-Technical
I have 7 files in this project: cell-count csv, cell-count-result.csv, CellConvertion.py, Question2a.py, queries.sql, Question2b, and schema.sql. 

Python:
The CellConvertion.py is the python code for Question 1 that reads cell-count.csv and generates cell-count-result.csv based on the requirement. Question2a.py is the code for Question 2 part a that asks to generate a boxplot. Question2b file contains my answer for question 2 part b that asks the difference between two cell populations. 

Database:
schema.sql contains my answer for Question 1 and 2 in database section; and queries.sql contains my answer for Question 3, 4, and 5 in database section. 

I really appreciate the opportunity to take this technical exam! Thank you so much for your time and consideration!
