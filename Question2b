b. Which cell populations are significantly different in relative frequencies between responders and non-responders? \
Please include statistics to support your conclusion.

answer:
I didn't figure out all the code that is require to generate a boxplot, but I can list the factors
that are important to compare which cell population are different in relative frequencies:
-mean frequencies for responders and non-responders
-mean difference between responders and non-responders
-p-values
-significance flag(p < 0.05)
if the populations has p-value that is less than 0.05, we will consider it significant different
